##The Automated Legal Document Analysis Platform is a powerful web application that automates the analysis of legal documents, extracting key information and identifying potential risks. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models, the platform helps users understand complex legal clauses, detect hidden risks, and make informed decisions when handling legal documents like contracts.
##This platform provides features such as document analysis, paraphrasing, sentiment analysis, and more, using modern technologies like Next.js, Flask, and PyTorch.

##Features
Automated Legal Document Analysis: Analyze legal documents to extract critical clauses, terms, and potential risks automatically.
Reading Comprehension Model: Trained on the SQuAD dataset, enabling users to extract information directly from legal documents.
CUAD Dataset: A specialized dataset consisting of 500 contracts, designed to address common questions in the legal field.
Paraphrasing Model: Built using the T5-base model, this helps users better understand complex contract clauses through paraphrasing.
Sentiment Analysis: Utilizes TextBlob to analyze the sentiment of legal clauses, providing insights into the tone and potential risks.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed with Next.js, ensuring a seamless and interactive experience for users.
Flask Server Integration: Connects the front-end interface with the backend machine learning models for efficient data processing.
Docker Containerization: Simplifies deployment by packaging the entire application in Docker, enabling easy setup and scalability.
